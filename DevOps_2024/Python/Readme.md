## Python Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Frameworks

If you are new to Python, you might be confused about - libraries, packages, modules, and frameworks. From the context, these are some pieces of code but whatâ€™s the difference between them?

- **Module** is the smallest piece of software. A module is a collection of methods or functions that are ready to be used elsewhere. 

```
  - Ex - Json
```
- **Packages** are basically a directory of a collection of modules. Packages allow the hierarchical structure of the module namespace
    - There are a lot of built-in and open-source Python packages
      ```
    - ex : NumPy, pandas
 ```
- **Library** contains a collection of related modules and packages
```
- ex : PyTorch, Requests 
```
- **Frameworks** are a collection of modules and packages that help programmers to fast track the development process.
    -while libraries contain packages that perform specific operations, frameworks contain the basic flow and architecture of the application. 
```
- ex : Django, Flash 
```
