# AWS Partner: Accreditation (Technical)

## Background info: 
* Before cloud services companies has their own data centers that has resources and physically components like servers
* Now: we have cloud

## What is cloud computing? 
* Cloud computing refers to on-demand resouces delivery through internet
* resources include: compute, storage, database, applications, etc.

## What are the benifits of cloud computing? 
* Agiltiy --> easily assecible resouces at any time
* Elasticity --> scale up or down on resouces depending on need (automatically)
* Cost saving -->  save on buying physically components amd building for data center
* Deploy globally in minutes → cloud providers have infra all around the world 

## AWS global cloud infrastructure 
* aws cloud can deploy resources globally
* aws services allow users to implement redundancy
    * redundancy --> duplication/replication of something
    * fault tolerance 
  ### How does cloud do this?
  * Regions: cluster of AZs
  * Availability zones: cluster of data centers
  * Edge locations: global location where data is cached
    ** currently +400 locations 
    ** CloudFront??

## AWS core technology? 
* Aws provide resources for: compute, storage, database, security, management, and networking 

  ### Compute --> EC2
* EC2 is an AWS service that provides computing services, as it supply user with virtual instances(VMs) 

  ### Storage --> S3 and Elastic Block Store(EBS)
* What is S3?
  * It is an object level storage
    * piece of data is treated as a separate object
  * Stores data in resources called bucket
  * Common use is → as data lake, backup and storage, app hosting, software hosting, media hosting
  * Data lake → entralized repository, stores raw data
  * Ustructured so stores everything
* What is EBS?
  * It is block level storage
  * fixed-sized blocks
  * Hard drive of EC2 instances 


  ### Database --> RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache 
  ### Security --> IAM
  ### Management
  ### Networking --> VPC, Route 53
