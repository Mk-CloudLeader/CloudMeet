## What is NTP amplification attack

An NTP amplification attack is a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. In this attack, the attacker uses publicly accessible Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers 
to overwhelm a target system with UDP traffic. NTP is used by machines connected to the Internet to set their clocks accurately.

In an NTP amplification attack, the attacker sends short requests to an open NTP server. The response from the NTP server is dozens of times larger than the request. 
This is called the amplification effect.
