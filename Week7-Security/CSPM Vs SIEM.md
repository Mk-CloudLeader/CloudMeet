# Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Vs Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Both are Cloud security tools
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSPM	SIEM	Remarks
Tool : Wiz , prisma Cloud, Palo Alto,Check Point CloudGuard	Tool : Rapid7, Splunk, ArcSight	
A CSPM solution will enable you to get to a secure baseline and then continuously evaluate against that secure baseline to detect when misconfigurations occur. 	SIEM helps organizations recognize and address potential security threats and vulnerabilities	AWS Security Hub Vs ArcSight/Rapid7

Examples of this include datastores being exposed to the internet, logging not being turned on, encryption not being turned on, or lack of MFA, appear.
CSPM can be integrated with SIEM to provide additional insight and visibility into policy violations and misconfigurations.	SIEM collects and combines data from event sources across an organization's IT and security framework. 	SEIM - ex : CW integration with ArcSgith,Rapid7
CSPM can also be integrated with DevOps toolsets to ensure quicker response and remediation	SIEM provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. 	
CSPM can help organizations ensure they have the right cloud security posture in three main areas: 		
        • Configuration
        • Identity access and control
        • Data protection
Some CSPM solutions can also auto-remediate threats		CSPM -Ex: AWS Security Hub
