### what is S3 Access Points and when can be used?
Easily manage access for shared datasets on Amazon S3. With S3 Access Points, customers can create unique access control policies for each access point to easily control access to shared datasets. Customers with shared datasets including data lakes, media archives, and user-generated content can easily scale access for hundreds of applications by creating individualized access points with names and permissions customized for each application.

Any access point can be restricted to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to firewall S3 data access within customersâ€™ private networks, and AWS Service Control Policies can be used to ensure all access points are VPC restricted


- Cost - No additional cost
- Each access point has own policy

### Problem statement :
There is s3 bucket and it is used to store data that is shared among different applications/teams with different levels of access requirement
-	With time the S3 bucket policy becomes big, gets regularly updated and hence difficult to audit
-	It is one per bucket and there is a limit on its size
-	This single policy is responsible for controlling access of dozens to hundreds of applications/teams to a bucket 

==> S3 Access Points  will resolve this issue
